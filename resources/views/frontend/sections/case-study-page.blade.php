                            high-stress individual employed as an electrician jointing high
                            voltage lines. As a higher rate taxpayer with significant family
                            expenses, Sam faced a high-risk decision to start his own business.
                            With a wife returning to university after a 10-year break to care for
                            their two children, the stakes were high.</p>

                            implications, and whether his take-home pay would be affected. His
                            high-stress nature and need for constant reassurance made him
                            apprehensive about every aspect of the transition</p>
